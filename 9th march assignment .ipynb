    "In other words, the probability mass function assigns a particular probability to every possible value of a discrete random variable.\n",

    "Probability Mass Function Example\n",
    "Suppose a fair coin is tossed twice and the sample space is recorded as S = [HH, HT, TH, TT]. The probability of getting heads needs to be determined. \n",
    "Let X be the random variable that shows how many heads are obtained. X can take on the values 0, 1, 2. The probability that X will be equal to 1 is 0.5. Thus, \n",
    "it can be said that the probability mass function of X evaluated at 1 will be 0.5.\n",

    "Probability Density Function (PDF)?\n",
    "Probability density function (PDF) is a statistical expression that defines a probability distribution (the likelihood of an outcome) for a discrete random variable (e.g., a stock or ETF) as opposed to a continuous random variable.\n",
    "The difference between a discrete random variable is that you can identify an exact value of the variable.\n",

    "Example of probability density function\n",
    "As a simple example of a probability distribution, let us look at the number observed when rolling two standard six-sided dice.\n",
    "Each die has a 1/6 probability of rolling any single number, one through six, but the sum of two dice will form the probability distribution"
